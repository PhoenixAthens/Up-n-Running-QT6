## Let's get some doubts cleared, shall we?

Q1: what does the default copy constructor generated by a c++ compiler for a cpp class in QT looks like?

A: The default copy constructor generated by the C++ compiler for a class in Qt follows the same rules as any other C++ class. If the class does not have any user-defined copy constructor, the compiler will automatically generate a default copy constructor that performs a shallow copy of the object's members.

The default copy constructor generated by the compiler will have the following form

```c++
ClassName(const ClassName& other)
    : member1(other.member1), member2(other.member2), ...
{
    // No additional code needed for shallow copy
}
```

Here's how it works:

1. The copy constructor takes a const reference to an object of the same class type as the parameter.

2. It initializes each non-static data member of the new object with the corresponding data member of the source object using the member initializer list.

3. For non-static data members that are of class type, their copy constructors are called.

4. For non-static data members that are of primitive types (e.g., int, double), a simple copy is performed.

5. For non-static data members that are pointers, the pointer values are copied, resulting in a shallow copy (both objects will point to the same memory location).

If the class contains any dynamically allocated memory (e.g., pointers to dynamically allocated memory), the default copy constructor will result in shallow copying, which can lead to undefined behavior when the copied object or the original object is destroyed. In such cases, you need to define your own copy constructor to perform a deep copy, where dynamically allocated memory is duplicated.

It's important to note that if your class has any members that are pointers or references to dynamically allocated memory, or if it has any non-trivial members (like file handles, network connections, etc.), you should define your own copy constructor to ensure proper copying and resource management.

Q2: In case of the following QT code
```C++
void test(Laptop laptop){
    laptop.test();
}
void createObj(){
    Laptop l1{nullptr,"Dell"};
    l1.weightInPounds = 12;
    Laptop l2{nullptr,"Vaio"};
    l2.weightInPounds = 5;
    test(l1);
    test(l2);
}
```
I haven't defined a copy-constructor in the class definition for laptop, if the default constructor automatically creates a shallow copy, then why am I getting this error "call to implicitly deleted copy constructor of laptop" when running `test` method

A: The issue is that the `Laptop` class contains a member variable `name` of type `QString`. The `QString` class in QT manages dynamic memory internally, and its copy constructor is marked as non-copyable (deleted).

When you try to create a copy of an object that contains a non-copyable member, the compiler cannot generate a default copy constructor for that class. This is why you're getting the error "call to implicitly deleted copy contructor of Laptop" when you try to pass a `Laptop` object by value to the `test` function.

To fix this issue, you have a few options:
1. **Pass `Laptop` objects by reference**: Instead of passing `Laptop` objects by value, pass them by reference. This way you won't need to create a copy, and the compiler won't try to generate a copy constructor.
```C++
void test(const Laptop& laptop) {
    laptop.test();
}
```
2. **Define your own copy contructor**: You can define your own copy constructor for the `Laptop` class and handle the copying of the `QString` member correctly. In this case, you'll need to use the `QString`'s copy constructor to create a deep copy of the `name` member.
```C++

Laptop::Laptop(const Laptop& other)
    : QObject(other.parent()), name(other.name), weightInPounds(other.weightInPounds) {
    // No additional code needed
}
```
3. **Use smart pointers or move semantics**: If you're managing dynamically allocated resources in the `Laptop` class, consider using smart pointers (e.g.,  `std::unique_ptr`,  `std::shared_ptr`) or move semantics to transfer ownership instead of copying.
